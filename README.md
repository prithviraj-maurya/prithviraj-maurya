🧪 Selected Projects

🗣️ Voice Assistants — Converting the Point of View

Research | NLP | Transformers
	•	Built a hybrid rule-based + ML system to convert the point of view (POV) of voice assistant messages across multiple languages (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant).
	•	Trained sequence-to-sequence transformer models (T5) achieving a BLEU score of 65.9.
	•	Awarded a State-of-the-Art (SOTA) badge on Papers With Code for best-reported results.
	•	Published research and open-sourced the work, demonstrating strong applied NLP and research rigor.

🍽️ Vision Transformer Replication & Food Vision Big (Deployed)

Computer Vision | Transformers | PyTorch | Hugging Face | Gradio
	•	Replicated the seminal paper “An Image is Worth 16×16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale” from first principles to deeply understand the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture.
	•	Implemented ViT end-to-end from scratch, including:
	•	Image patching & flattening
	•	Learnable patch and positional embeddings
	•	Transformer encoder blocks with Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) and MLP layers
	•	Validated correctness by training on the Pizza–Steak–Sushi dataset, reproducing the paper’s core learning behavior.

🚀 Food Vision Big — Production-Ready Image Classifier
	•	Built and deployed Food Vision Big, a real-world food image classifier supporting 101 food categories using the Food101 dataset (101K images).
	•	Leveraged EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning for high accuracy and efficient inference.
	•	Trained locally on NVIDIA RTX 4060, demonstrating large-scale CV training on consumer hardware.
	•	Developed an interactive Gradio UI and deployed the application on Hugging Face Spaces for public access.
